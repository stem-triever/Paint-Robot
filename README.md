Autonomous robot for large scale painting

This project is to investigate the feasibility of autonomous structural paint robot to restore commerical building based on 3D model acquired from HD photo. 3D model are constructed from HD photo via software Lumion (or alike), the real challenge is how to do it properly with paint robot. Therefore, large scale paint robot is the main theme of this repository.

Possibility : Check out XArm from ufactory.com (a kickstarter project) and see how it fits into the spider crane to mobilize.
